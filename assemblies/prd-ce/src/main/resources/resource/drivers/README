Big data drivers are not included by default. You are required to download the drivers 
individually from the support portal, if desired. The support portal is available at
https://support.pentaho.com/hc/en-us. After downloading a big data driver, unzip the
archive, run the installer, add the resulting .kar file to this directory and then
restart the application.

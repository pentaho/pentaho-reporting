  <h2>Mondrian DataSource migration from Pentaho Reporting 3.9.1 or older to Pentaho Reporting 5.0.0</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
      With Pentaho Reporting 5.0 we change how we reference Mondrian schema files on the server. In the
      previous releases schema files were stored along side the normal content in the solution repository.
      Pentaho BA-Server 5.0 stored schemas in a schema registry and the files are no longer directly accessible.
  </p>
  <p>
      Inside the registry, each schema can be referenced by its schema name. The names of the schemas must be unique
      and is defined by the schema author. When you create a new Mondrian datasource in Pentaho Reporting, you now
      must provide a matching schema name for the schema you reference.
  </p>
  <p>
      This migration step attempts to load the referenced schema files from your local file system and tries to
      fill in the schema name into all Mondrian datasources.

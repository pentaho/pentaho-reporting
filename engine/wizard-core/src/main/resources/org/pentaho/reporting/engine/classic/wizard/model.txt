The wizard-definitions is a extra object-structure, described via
an own API.

The wizard is executed as a report-customizer and runs on every
start of a pagination-run before the report is executed.

The data for the wizard and the reporting run is defined on
the report itself using the standard data-factory interface.

The wizard only modifies empty bands or bands marked as
modifiable by the wizard. The content on these bands will
be replaced during the processing.

Groups are generated in relation to any existing grouping.
Groups are keyed by name, so any wizard-group tries to reuse
existing groups.

Groups are evaluated in the order they are declared in the
wizard. A group is matched only against subgroups.

Reports are either relational or crosstab. The wizard definition
overrides the report-template definition.

If a crosstab template is used for relational reports, the
crosstab on the template is removed.

Groups can have personalities:
* Relational
* Row-Axis
* Column-Axis

In the wizard, Grouping always happens on a single field.

The wizard does not try to reuse field-computations. It always
creates own expressions and functions.

The wizard reuses the Row-Banding definition, if the report defines
one.

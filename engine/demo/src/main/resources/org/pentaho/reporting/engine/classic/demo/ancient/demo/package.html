Classes making up the demonstration application for the JFreeReport Class Library.
You will need the icons and report definitions in the classpath. Also make sure that you
have an JAXP-Compatible XML-Parser included in your classpath.
<p>
  To start the demo, use org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.demo.JFreeReportDemo as mainclass. To start
  a special version of the demo with really huge reports, try to start
  org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.demo.HugeJFreeReportDemo. But be patient, the reports 5 and 6 there
  have several thousand records. It will take time to perform the reporting.

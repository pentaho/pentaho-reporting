<h2>
  Sportscouncil demo: Printing complex data structures
</h2>

<p>
  This report prints an annual report about the sport activities of an
  University.
</p>

<h3>
  The Data Model
</h3>

<p>
  The University in question has a sports council, whose members are the
  various organizations built around the sport activities of the university.
</p>

<p>
  Each of these organization has one or more su-organizations to perform their
  tasks. This report provides an overview about the events organized by each
  (sub)organization and their member structure.
</p>

<p>
  Each organization also has a designated leader, who is responsible for the
  activities of the organization.
</p>

<p>
  As a report usually contains more than one organization, the sport
  organizations have a unique key, which can be queried through the 'orgID'
  column.
</p>

<p>
  It was a requirement for the particular report, that for each organization
  the organization's leaders are printed in a separate section, followed by the
  organization's event and member statistics.
</p>

<p>
  The data model follows this requirement and therefore contains two separate
  lists for the leader records and the organization records. Each row in the
  tablemodel carries the record type in the 'recordID' column.
</p>

<h3>General structure of the report</h3>

<p>
  The report consists of two group levels and specialized itembands for each
  record type.
</p>

<p>
  The first grouping level splits the report data source into separate
  organizations. The 'organization' group's header prints the standard
  information about the organizations, like the address, who's in charge etc.
</p>

<p>
  The second group level splits the organization rows into leader-records and
  organization records. An HideElementByNameFunction is used to control the
  visibility of the bands and to show only bands with a name equal to the
  record type. Note that the table model automaticly keeps the various record
  types together, so that exactly one group is instantiated for each record
  type.

<h2>Printing multiple tables</h2>

<p>
  This demo introduces the JoiningTableModel and shows how to use this class
  to print reports with multiple table models.
</p>

<h3>The JoiningTableModel</h3>

<p>
  We use the JoiningTableModel to join both tablemodels. That
  tablemodel behaves like a primitive version of an SQL-Union
  operation.
</p>

<p>
  The Joining Tablemodel combines two independent Tables into
  one large tablemodel. The resulting tablemodel contains all
  columns of the both models and an additional column called
  'TablePrefix'. The column namess of the original table models
  are preceeded by the value stored in the TablePrefix column.
</p>

<p>
  Assume we have the following table models:
</p>

<p>
  <code>TableModel modelA = new DefaultTableModel();</code>
  Contents:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>T1C1</th>
    <th>T1C2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>D</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  <code>TableModel modelB = new DefaultTableModel();</code>
  Contents:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>T2C1</th>
    <th>T2C2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  We join the tablemodels with the following code:
  <pre>
    JoinedTableModel joinedTable = new JoinedTableModel();
    joinedTable.add ("t_1", modelA);
    joinedTable.add ("t_2", modelB);
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  The resulting tablemodel contents will be:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>TablePrefix</th>
    <th>t_1.T1C1</th>
    <th>t_1.T1C2</th>
    <th>t_2.T2C1</th>
    <th>t_2.T2C2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>t_1</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>t_1</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>t_2</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>t_2</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>General Structure</h3>

<p>
  When printing the report we have to alter the visibility of
  those bands, which should not be printed for the current
  row type.
</p>

<p>
  For that task, we add a function, that preforms that task for
  us. To make things easier for the function and to increase
  maintainability of the report definition, we put all elements
  for a certain row type into separate bands. The
  <code>HideElementByNameFunction</code> we use to alter the
  bands visiblities expects the name of the band, that should be changed by
  the function, to match the contents of the "TablePrefix" column.
</p>

<p>
  We added one function for every record type. The record types
  used are 'fruit' for the fruit table data and 'color' for the
  color table.
  <pre>
    &lt;function class="org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.function.HideElementByNameFunction"
    name="hideColors"&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;property name="element"&gt;color&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="field"&gt;TablePrefix&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;/function&gt;

    &lt;function class="org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.function.HideElementByNameFunction"
    name="hideFruits"&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;property name="element"&gt;fruit&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="field"&gt;TablePrefix&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;/function&gt;
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  When comparing the combined report agains the single reports,
  you will notice that all table column references have the name
  of the table (as specified in the JoinedTableModel.add(..)
  method) added as prefix to the column name.
</p>

<h3>Groups</h3>

<p>
  To separate the two reports, we introduce a group level
  that separates the reports by it's "TablePrefix" column.
</p>

<p>
  That top-level group only has an empty Group-header which
  is used to force a pagebreak between the two reports.
</p>

<p>
  Within the invoice and advertising reports, all group field
  definitions have been extended to contain the "TablePrefix"
  column as group column.
</p>

<p>
  To get a defined order of the reports, the joined version of
  the advertising report needs to add all fields from the deepest
  group of the invoice report. Technically, the advertising
  report is now a child report of the invoice report. As the
  HideElementByNameFunction hides the invoice report contents
  whenever 'Advertising' contents are printed, that dependency
  is hidden and has no visual representation to the user.
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
  Although the report definition is split into separate files, this is no
  requirement to generate this kind of reports. The separate files are used
  only for the purpose to mirror the logically separation on a physical level.

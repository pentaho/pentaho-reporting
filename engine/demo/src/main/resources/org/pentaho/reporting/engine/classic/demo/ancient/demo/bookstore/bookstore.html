<h2>Bookstore Demo - Simple Invoice Printing</h2>

<h3>Data Structure</h3>

<p>
  The used tablemodel contains several customers, identified by their name and
  address. Each customer buys one or more books, identified by the book's ID-code.
</p>

<p>
  The report grouping follows that structure and introduces a single group called
  'Customer'. The group's fields are mapped against the customer data in the
  tablemodel ('name', 'address', 'town').
</p>

<h3>Layout Structure</h3>

<p>
  The general contract declares, that a group header is always printed before
  any itemband can be printed. A group contains all successional rows, which share
  a common set of properties (identified by the group fields). If one of the
  columns changes, the group is considered finished and the group footer is
  printed. If there is at least one more row, a new group instance will be opened
  immediatly.
</p>

<p>
  We use that behaviour to print the invoice header in the group header band.
  Following the contract above, we can be sure that the invoice header is printed
  for each customer before the items get processed. The group footer contains
  the summary section of the invoice.
</p>

<p>
  To keep the report definition simple, we did not add any pagebreak handling
  functionality. Therefore the report will start to look funny if there are
  more items per customer than would fit on a single page. A complexer invoice
  demo, that handles such cases, can be found in the 'Invoice' demo package.
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>
  The invoice total is computed using a 'ItemSumFunction'. That function computes
  a running total. When used in the GroupFooter of the function's group, the
  running total will be equal to the grand total for that group instance.
  As an alternative function, the 'TotalItemSumFunction' could be used. This
  function precomputes the grand total and will always return the total sum,
  no matter where the function's value is used.
</p>

<h3>Noteworthy features</h3>

<p>
  The butterfly image is a WMF image. WMF, like SVG is a vector graphics format
  and produces the best results for high-resolution printing. If you have the
  choice between vector and raster image, choose the vector images.
</p>

<p>
  The 'sheetNameExpression' defined in the report definition is not referenced
  by any report element. The name of the function has been assigned to the
  configuration key 'org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.targets.table.TableWriter.SheetNameFunction'.
  The table exporter targets will now use this expression to set the sheet name
  (HTML title or Excel Workbook sheet name).

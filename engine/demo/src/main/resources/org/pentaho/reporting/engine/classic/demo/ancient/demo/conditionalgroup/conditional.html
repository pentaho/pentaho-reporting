<h2>Conditional groups</h2>

<p>
  This demo shows how to define conditional groups. The report for
  this demo creates a Profit and Loss Statement report for the Open
  Source accounting package jGnash. The expected output looks like:
</p>
  <pre>
  Income
    Account 1                                      9999.99
    Account 2                                      9999.99
  Total Income                                    99999.99

  Expense
    Account A
      Account Z                                      99.99
      Account Y                                     999.99
    Total Account A                                9999.99

    Account B                                      9999.99

  Total Expense                                   99999.99

  Net Profit/Loss                                 99999.99
  </pre>
<p>
  As you can see, account 'A' has sub accounts, which should be printed,
  while account 'B' has no sub accounts. According to the control-break-algorithm,
  either each group must have sub groups, or no group must have sub
  groups.
</p>

<p>
  We can solve the conflict rather easily by hiding the second level
  group header and footer when the account has no sub groups. We will
  discuss the used function later.
</p>

<h3>Data Structure</h3>

<p>
  The data is formatted as follows:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>type</th>
    <th>level-one-account</th>
    <th>level-two-account</th>
    <th>balance</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Income</td>
    <td>Account 1</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>9999.99</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Income</td>
    <td>Account 2</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>9999.99</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Expense</td>
    <td>Account A</td>
    <td>Account Z</td>
    <td>9999.99</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Expense</td>
    <td>Account A</td>
    <td>Account Y</td>
    <td>9999.99</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Expense</td>
    <td>Account B</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>9999.99</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  As you can see here, the table contains the necessary structures to
  support two levels of accounts. If an account has no sub accounts,
  the 'level-two-account' column is null for these rows. We will use
  that null-value as indicator whether the second level group header
  should be hidden.
</p>

<h3>The report structure</h3>

<p>
  The magical work is done by two functions, TriggerNestedGroupFunction
  and TriggerTypeFunction.
</p>

<p>
  The TriggerTypeFunction processes the top group and shows and hides
  the income and expense headers depending on the content of the
  "type" column of the assigned tablemodel.
</p>

<p>
  The TriggerNestedGroupFunction checks, whether the current group
  is a nested group. A nested group is recognized by its non-null
  content in the column "level-two-account". Depending on whether a nested
  group is found, either the itemband for the nested group and the
  group header and footer for that group are made visible or the
  normal, non-nested itemband is made visible.
</p>

<p>
  A third custom function collects the totals from the income and expense
  group and computes the netto profit. As this function reuses the results
  from other function, we have to make sure, that the used functions are
  executed before the netto-profit function tries to query the sums.
  This is done by declaring a dependency level for the used functions,
  which is higher than the dependency level for the netto-profit function
  (which defaults to '0').

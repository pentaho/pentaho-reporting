<h2>2.&nbsp;Report groups</h2>

<p>Reports used in the real-world-business are more than simple list of
  rows and columns. To gain information from the presented data, the
  report data is sorted and condensed into separate sections, which
  corespond to the logical structure of the report. Therefore report
  engines introduced the concept of groups to support the structuring of
  report data.</p>

<p>With groups, a set of rows, the report data set, is subdivided into an
  ordered collection of smaller subsets of rows. All rows of a group
  instance share a common attribute. In the domain of relational
  databases, the attribute is defined by the name of one or more columns.
  Within the group instance, all those columns have the same value. That
  set of attributes, which identifies a group, is called the group
  key.</p>

<p>Groups in the reporting usually can be mapped to 'is-part-of' relations
  in the real world. Employees could be grouped by the department, where
  they work in, or by the first letter of their last name.</p>

<h3>2.1.&nbsp;The Control-Break-Algorithm</h3>

<p>Reporting can be a very resource intenstive process. Data has to be
  queried from databases and other sources, the data must be processed,
  sorted and intermediate results must be computed and finally the
  report output must be generated. Even with today's powerfull
  computers, performance is a key to customer satisfaction. To fullfill
  these performance requirements, it is unacceptable to waste time
  building a global view on the report data unless absolutly
  necessary.</p>

<p>For performance reasons, group memberships are computed at runtime
  with an algorithm called the 'control-break algorithm'. Understanding
  this algorithm is the key to successful reporting, as this algorithm
  heavily influences how the report engine behaves and how groups are
  built up. The control-break-algorithm does not build a global view
  over all group instances. To detect the end or start of a group, it
  compares the current row with the previously read row of data. If the
  data of one of the group's key columns is different, the current group
  must be finished. If the report processing has not reached the last
  row, a new group instance is opened immediatly. This new group will
  remain active until either the end of the report data has been reached
  or the group key values changed.</p>

<p><em>Definition:</em></p>

<p>A <em>group</em> is a contigiuous set of rows,
  where all rows of the group share the same group key.</p>

<p>A <em>group instance</em> is identified by a <em>group key</em>.
  The key consists of one or
  more attributes, where all entites in that group have the same values
  stored in the specified attributes. When using databases, entity sets
  are usually represented by tables and attributes are represented by
  the table's columns.</p>

<p>A <em>sub group</em> is a group, which has a key
  that contains all attributes of its parent and has at least one more
  attribute. Therefore, a sub group contains a subset of it's parent's
  rows.</p>

<p>A group with a group key without attributes defined is called the
  <em>default group</em>. This group has a single
  instance which always spans the complete report data set.</p>

<p>The single level Control-Break-Algorithm as pseudo code:</p>
  <pre>OPEN data-set.
    READ record.

    PRINT report-header.

    WHILE NOT END-OF-FILE
    DO
    VAR groupKey := GET-CURRENT-GROUP-KEY.
    PRINT group-header.

    WHILE (NOT END-OF-FILE AND
    groupKey IS-EQUAL-TO GET-CURRENT-GROUP-KEY)
    DO
    PRINT item-band.
    READ
    DONE.

    PRINT group-footer.

    DONE

    PRINT report-footer.
    CLOSE data-set.</pre>

<p>and in Java (the complete code for this listing can be found is in
  CVS):</p>
  <pre> public static void main (final
    String[] args)
    {
    final Object[][] data = initData();

    // cursor at the first row ...
    // in this example modifying the 'position' is equal to a 'read'
    operation
    int position = 0;

    printReportHeader(data, position);
    while (isEndOfFile (data, position) == false)
    {
    // initialize the group key with the data from the first row
    // remember the current group key
    // if the group key changes, we have to do a control break ...
    final Object groupKey = data[position][CONTINENT_COL];
    printGroupHeader(data, position);

    while ((isEndOfFile (data, position) == false) &amp;&amp;
    (data[position][CONTINENT_COL].equals(groupKey)))
    {
    // store the last value of the group key (so that we can detect changes)

    // print the items ...
    printItems (data, position);

    // now 'read' the next row of data ...
    position += 1;
    }
    printGroupFooter(data, position - 1);
    }

    printReportFooter(data, position - 1);
    }</pre>

<p>From this algorithm, we can derive some basic principles about groups
  as they are used in JFreeReport.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Data used in group keys
    must be sorted according to the group hierarchy definition.</p>

    <p>As only neighbouring rows are compared against each other, this
      algorithm will consider rows to be part of the currrent group if and
      only if all rows of a particular group key instance are kept
      together as direct neigbours in the report dataset.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>A group with no attributes defined will have a single instance, which
    spans the complete report data set.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>As long as there is
    data available, a new group instance will be opened immediatly after
    the previous instance has been closed down. It is not possible to
    print the item band without having an open group.</p></li>

  <li><p>The
    order of the attribute specification within a group definition is not
    important. For the algorithm it is important, that one attribute value
    have changed, it is not important, which one changed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By considering the group data to be a new data set, we can stack
  multiple control-break runs into each other. These multi-level control
  breaks add some new behavioural constraints to the engine.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li><p>A sub group can only be
    opened, after its parent group has been opened.</p>

    <p>Subgroup processing starts as soon as the group header of the
      parent group has been printed. Immediatly after the processing
      finishes, the parent group's footer gets printed. The processing
      flow cannot reach the subgroup without passing through the parent
      group.</p></li>

  <li><p>A sub group must cease control as soon as one
    the parent's group attributes changes.</p>

    <p>A control break in one of the parent groups will close all
      subgroups. As soon as the parent group generated a new group
      instance, new instances of the sub groups will be opened as
      well.</p>

    <p>Therefore sub groups must be aware of the group attributes of it's
      parents.</p></li>

  <li><p>Adding an attribute, which has a constant
    value, to the group definition will not alter the number or order of
    the generated group instances.</p></li>

  <li><p>A group can only have
    one directly attached sub group.</p></li>
</ol>

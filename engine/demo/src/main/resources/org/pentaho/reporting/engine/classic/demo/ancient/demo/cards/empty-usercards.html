<h2>Card demo</h2>

<p>
  An internet cafe provides several payment models for their customers.
  Whenever a user pays for an account, he gets a printed card with the account
  details and can use the data on these cards to login to the systems.
</p>

<p>
  There are several card types available:
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Free card</h4>

    <p>
      From time to time, the internet cafes grants free access, ususally during
      a large scale advertising campaign or as bonus to customers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Prepaid card</h4>

    <p>
      The user paid a certain amount of cash, without giving account details to
      the internet cafe. Great for the occasional user. The card number is
      used for the login.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Account card</h4>

    <p>
      An account for a certain user. The account does not expire.
      The user has an unique login name and password to access the systems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>User card</h4>

    <p>
      An account for a certain user. The account remains open for the duration
      of the contract (1 month, 3 month, 1 year, ..). The user has an unique
      login name and password.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Admin card</h4>

    <p>
      Our admins get unlimited bandwidth when using the system. Of course they
      also have a user name and password.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  This demo simulates the printing functionality of that internet cafe management
  software.
</p>

<h3>Skipping previously printed cards</h3>

<p>
  Usually it is not economic to start a new sheet of paper for each single card
  printed. It must be possible to skip previously printed cards from the sheet
  of paper. Instances of 'EmptyCard' got added to the report as placeholders for
  sections that should not be printed on.
</p>

<h3>Data structure</h3>

<p>
  All cards that should be printed get added to the CardTableModel. That model
  is a union over all possible properties each available card may have. The first
  column contains the card type identifier. Columns not used by the given card
  type remain empty (null).
</p>

<p>
  We want to print two cards in a row. JFreeReport's code assumes, that each
  row in the tablemodel is mapped to an item band in the report. We are having
  a single card per row, so we have to modify the tablemodel to map two
  cards to a row.
</p>

<p>
  For that purpose, we introduced a 'WrappingTablemodel', which performs that
  mapping. Two rows of the original tablemodel get mapped into a single row
  of the WrappingTableModel. The first and all odd-numbered rows of the original
  tablemodel form the left side of the table. All these columns are prefixed
  with a 'C1_'. All even numbered rows form the right side of the resulting
  table and all columns there are prefixed with 'C2_'.
</p>

<h3>Report Layout</h3>

<p>
  The itemband will have to double all elements as we have to print the cards
  for the left (C1_) and right (C2_) side of the table. For each card type,
  a subband will be used, which is triggered visible or invisible depending
  on the card type to be printed.
</p>

<p>
  The report uses the extended XML configuration. First, we define the styles
  for all report elements in the 'style' section. This reduces the redundancy
  of the report definition, as we can use shared styles.
</p>

<p>
  In a second step, we define the 'templates' for the band elements. Templates
  define, how data is processed for the output. As we are mostly using string
  fields, the templates of this report are rather simple. The 'simple-datefield'
  template defined in this report shows how templates could be used to reduce
  the redundancy of the data definition in a similiar fashion as it was done with
  the style definitions above.
</p>

<p>
  Finally we construct the itemband (the only root level band in this report).
  The itemband contains two direct childs, a band for the left and one for the
  right card. In each of these child bands, exactly the same subband definitions
  get used. Each element definition there consists of a single style definition
  and a single template definition, inheriting their properties from the global
  definition sections.
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>
  To control the visibility of the band, a special function is used. The
  'SelectCardFunction' uses the specified card type column to trigger the
  visiblity of the card bands. Two instances of this function get used,
  one for the left side and one for the right side of the itemband.
</p>

<p>
  The report properties used to define the internet cafe's name are initialized
  with default values.

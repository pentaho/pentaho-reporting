<h2>Welcome to the JFreeReport Demo</h2>

<p>
  If you are new developer in the world of JFreeReport, you should start your
  journey with the 'Hello World' demo and the 'Color And Letter Group Demo'.
</p>

<p>
  The Hello World demo is a very simple demonstration of how to use JFreeReport
  to load a report definition from XML and to show a Preview-dialog. The
  groups demo explains the concept of 'groups' and shows how to define these
  groups in the XML definition.

<h3>Percentage Demo</h3>

<p>
  In this demo, the TableModel contains two columns A and B. The generated
  report displays the values in these columns, plus a third value (A/B)
  formatted as a percentage.
</p>

<p>
  Its only purpose is to provide a simple demonstration on how to
  add and use functions in a report.
</p>

<p>
  In JFreeReport, it makes no difference, where data actually comes
  from. No matter whether data is aquired from a function, from the
  tablemodel or a report property, it is all referenced and queried
  by its name. Functions may use the result of other functions for
  their computations. Printing these results is also straightforward,
  just reference the function's name in the report element and
  the function's value will be printed.
</p>

<h3>Data Model</h3>

<p>
  The report uses a very minimalistic table model, so keep everything
  simple and easy to understand. The table consists of two columns,
  named 'A' and 'B'. The resulting percentage is computed using a
  provided standard expression of JFreeReport, which follows the simple
  formula of (result = A / B).

<h2>Font Selection</h2>

<p>
  This simple demo prints sample text using all fonts available to the Java
  Virtual Maschine. The fonts are grouped by their font family. This demo
  is useful when trying to determine a font's unicode or PDF embedding
  capabilities.
</p>

<h3>Data Structure</h3>

<p>
  The table model is very simple. The two columns in the model represent the
  font name and the font family. The fonts itself are aquired using <code>
  GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().getAllFonts();
</code>. The contents are sorted by the font familiy to enable grouping.
</p>

<h3>Report Structure</h3>

<p>
  The report itself consists of a single group for the 'font family' printing
  the family name in the header and counting the number of fonts in that family
  in the footer of the group.
</p>

<p>
  The itemband prints the font name and a sample text. The SampleText field's
  font property gets modified by a function to match the current font.
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>
  The only noteworthy function here is the 'FontChangeFunction'. The function
  itself does not compute anything. Every registered function is called on
  every report event and is granted access to the report definition. We use
  that feature to lookup and modifiy the sample element's font properties.

<h2>
  Patient Form demo: Using the watermark band to print predefined form elements.
</h2>

<p>
  This report creates a patient form (including all treatments applied to the
  patient). A watermark band is used to generate the form preprinted structure.
</p>

<h3>
  The Data Model
</h3>

<p>
  The table model in question consists of a list of patients, each with some
  general data like name, address, social security number. For each patient
  exists a list of treatments, the patient had to go through.
</p>

<h3>General structure of the report</h3>

<p>
  This very simple report has a single level group definition. The report
  is grouped by the patient's ID and a pagebreak is enforced before a patient
  is printed.
</p>

<p>
  The pre-printed form elements are kept in the watermark band. The watermark
  is printed after a new page has been opened but before the page header gets
  printed. It is the first band to be printed on each page. A watermarks always
  spans the complete page and cannot trigger a pagebreak.
</p>

<p>
  Please note, that Watermark definitions are ignored for Table-Exports, like
  HTML or Excel.

<h2>Computer Shop Invoice Demo</h2>

<p>
  This demo prints a invoice for a computer shop. Some articles have an extended
  description (a serial number, a warning etc). The field for the extended
  description should not be visible, if there is no description at all.
</p>

<h3>General structure</h3>

<p>
  The report is grouped at its top level by the invoice column. That column holds the invoice object,
  important for the reporting is: The contents of this column are the same for all
  rows of a single invoice.
</p>

<p>
  The group header and footer are used to print the invoice header and summary sections.
  A second group with a dummy fields has been added to print the table header. The table
  header is repeated on every new page.
</p>

<h3>Special elements used in this report</h3>

<p>
  To hide the extendend article description element, if it is not used, the report
  uses a style-expression on the <code>visible</code> style-key to hide the article-details.
  Everytime the ItemBand is printed (that's when the method <code>itemAdvenced(..)</code>
  get called) this function checks, whether the "details" column contains a value and
  updates the element's visibility accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  To concat strings from the tablemodel and print them in one element, this report
  utilizes the TextFormatExpression. This expression looks up several values from the
  data row and inserts these values into a java.text.MessageFormat object. The resulting
  string can be printed using a <code>string-field</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Since JFreeReport 0.8.5 the <code>message-field</code> offers an alternate way to
  format strings for the output.

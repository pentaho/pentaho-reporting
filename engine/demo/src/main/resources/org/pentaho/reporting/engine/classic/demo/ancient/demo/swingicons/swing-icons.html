<h2>
  Swing Icons Demo: Showing a simple report with images.
</h2>

<h3>
  The Data Model
</h3>

<p>
  The table model contains 4 columns (category, name, icon and size). The data
  is retrieved from an external JAR file, which contains several PNG files stored
  within a directory. The directory name is used as category. The Icon's file name
  makes up the name of the image. The image data is used to build the actual
  icon. The size column corresponds to the filesize of the icon.
</p>

<h3>General structure of the report</h3>

<p>
  This very simple report has a single level group definition. The report
  is grouped by the category name. The tablemodel is sorted by the category.

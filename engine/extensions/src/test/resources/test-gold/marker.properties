# Do not remove this file. It is a marker file to help the test system
# locate this directory. The contents do not matter, its the file name
# we are looking for.

# The directory "reports" contains self-contained prpt files that can be
# run in a batch process. The reports will be run with both the pageable-xml
# and the table-xml module. The output generated by this will be streamed
# into a temp directory and then compared line by line with a pre-created
# known good sample.

# Tests like this act as a early smoke test to see whether the layouting has
# changed in a invalid way. The tests are shielded against changes in the
# runtime environment and do not use local fonts or graphics libraries. Tests
# will start failing whenever there is work done on the layouter system,
# and it is up to the developer to mark tests as good failures (change caused
# by intended code changes) or bad failures (random changes that are not
# wanted).

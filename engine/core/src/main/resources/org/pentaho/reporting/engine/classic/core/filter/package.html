Support for the creation of 'filter chains' used to transform data objects into
other forms for presentation on reports.

<h2>Basic flow of data in JFreeReport</h2>
Three interfaces create the abstract way of the dataflow in JFreeReport.
<p>

<h3>DataSource</h3>
By default all data used in the report's elements is read from DataSource
implementations. DataSource defines a single function called getValue() which
returns the current value of the datasource.
DataSources are stateless, and implementations should not maintain a state of the
process of querying data. It is not guaranteed that DataSources are in a particular
order.
If you need to maintain a state or get informed of events, you should implement a function
instead of using the DataSource interface.
<p>

<h3>DataTarget</h3>
A DataTarget is a container for a DataSource. A DataTarget queries the DataSource when
it needs new data. All elements of the report implement the DataTarget interface and query
its assigned DataSource whenever they need to print the data.
DataTargets should not rely on the data type of the data returned by the DataSource. If
they cannot handle the data returned by the DataSource, DataTargets should perform a controled
way of errorhandling instead of just throwing exceptions.
Some DataSources can return NullValues, so DataTargets will have to handle this case correctly.
<p>

<h3>DataFilter</h3>
A DataFilter is the conjunction of DataSource and DataTarget. If a DataFilter is queried to
return a value, the request if forwareded to the assigned DataSource of the filter. The returned
value is then processed and the result is returned.
<p>
<h4>FormatFilter and FormatParser</h4>
FormatFilter and FormatParsers are special implementations of the filter interface.
Both of them are using an implementation of <code>java.text.Format</code> to perform parsing
and formatting.
Commonly used implementation are the SimpleDateFormat to format and parse java.util.Date
objects and the DecimalFormat to parse and format Number instances.
<p>
  A FormatFilter implementation will try to create a string representation of an object using
  the <code>parse</code> method of its assigned <code>java.text.Format</code> object. It is
  guaranteed that a FormatFilter will return a default not null String in case that
  getValue() returns invalid values. This default string is defined by setNullString (String).

<p>
  A FormatParser implementation will try to parse a String read from its DataSource into an
  object. The actual work of parsing is delegated to the <code>java.text.Format</code>s
  <code>parse</code> method. If the string was null or invalid, and parsing was unable to create
  an object, a predefined value can be returned instead of <code>null</code>.

<p>

<h2>Common use cases of Filters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>label
    <p><i>
      The label prints predefined text in the report and is mostly used to name fields and columns
    </i></p>

    <p>The label uses a <code>StaticDataSource</code> to contain its datavalue. This DataSource is
      contained in the default StringFilter of <code>org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.TextElement</code>.
      The TextElements StringFilter will convert the static value into a string before it gets
      printed in the report.
    </p>
  <li>number-field
    <p><i>
      The number field reads its value from the reports datasource and formats the value using a
      decimal format, before the string representation is printed.
    </i></p>

    <p>The number-field uses a <code>ReportDataSource</code> to obtain values from the reports
      datamodel. These values are fed into a NumberFormatFilter, where they get formated using the
      <code>java.text.DecimalFormat</code>, resulting in a string. The TextElement will check the
      returned value, as this is a string, nothing is done and the string is printed. <br>
      In case the NumberFormat failed to format the value read from the source, it would return
      a <code>null</code> value to the TextElement to be printed. Now the TextElement's StringFilter
      will check the value, and return the predefined NullValue-String instead of <code>null</code>.
    </p>
  <li>date-function
    <p><i>
      The date function field queries the results of a function, and formats the function's return
      value into a string. The contents of this string can be defined using a format pattern as
      defined in <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat</code>.
    </i></p>

    <p>The date-function uses a <code>FunctionDataSource</code> to obtain values from the reports
      function collection. These values are fed into a SimpleDateFormatFilter, where they get formated
      using the <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat</code>, resulting in a string. The TextElement will
      check the returned value, as this is a string, nothing is done and the string is printed. <br>
      In case the DateFormat failed to format the value read from the source, it would return
      a <code>null</code> value to the TextElement to be printed. Now the TextElement's StringFilter
      will check the value, and return the predefined NullValue-String instead of <code>null</code>.
    </p>
</ul>
<p>
  These examples should give an idea what can be done with the filters. As filters can contain
  other filters, you are free to create any combination and put them into the elements.
</p>

<h2>DataRowConnectable</h2>

<p>
  Elements are connected to the Report's DataSources using a DataRow as connector. The DataRow unifies
  the access to functions, expressions and the tablemodel. DataSources that need to access one of these
  sources should use the DataRowDataSource as primary datasource. The specialized sources for accessing
  Functions and the Reports TableModel should not be used.

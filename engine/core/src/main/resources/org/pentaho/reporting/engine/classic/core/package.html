  Some rules when working with the report definition objects:
<ul>
  <li>Functions cannot be added to the report once the report generation has
    started.
  <li>Do not modify the report structure after the report
    generation is started, unless you know exactly what you are doing.
  <li>It is safe to modify the report definition <b>before</b> the report is
    started.
  <li>Once the report processing has started, the report from the report
    processor must not be reused for other purposes.
</ul>

<h2>Groups</h2>

<p>
  A group is a set of database rows, where the contents of the group
  fields are equal for all rows.
</p>

<p>
  Lets look at the following table:
</p>

<p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Car</th>
    <th>Color</th>
    <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Toyota</td>
    <td>blue</td>
    <td>10.000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Toyota</td>
    <td>blue</td>
    <td>20.000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Toyota</td>
    <td>red</td>
    <td>15.000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lexus</td>
    <td>blue</td>
    <td>25.000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lexus</td>
    <td>yellow</td>
    <td>15.000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BMW</td>
    <td>yellow</td>
    <td>40.000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BMW</td>
    <td>blue</td>
    <td>35.000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BMW</td>
    <td>green</td>
    <td>5.000</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
  Groups are always defined on sorted tables.
  A group is defined by selecting one or more rows, which should
  form the group. A group instance will contain all rows from the
  beginning of the group until one of the group fields changes.
</p>

<p>
  Lets select the row car for our group:
</p>

<p>
  Selecting that row as group argument will result in 3 group instances.
  The first group instance will contain the first 3 rows (as the contents
  of these rows are equal).
</p>

<p>
  The next instance will contain all rows of the "Lexus" car and the
  last group contains all rows from the "BMW" rows.
</p>

<p>
  If a group is defined by more than one field, then the group will end,
  if one of the group member fields changes.
</p>

<p>
  Lets define a group which consists of "Car" and "Color".
</p>

<p>
  The first instance of the group will contain the first 2 rows (Toyota,blue).
  Then the value in the column "Color" changes, so a new group
  instance is started. This new group contains a single row, as the
  column "Car" in the next row will contain a different value.
</p>

<p>
  The next two group instances are "Lexus, blue" and "Lexus, yellow", both
  group instances contain 1 row, as the color changes after 1 row.
</p>

<p>
  The next row starts a new group, as the column "Car" contains a different
  value (BWM instead of Lexus). It doesn't matter, that the color is still
  equal, to end a group instance, it is sufficient that one column value
  changed.

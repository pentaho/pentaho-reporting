The function package contains statefull functions and stateless expression for
JFreeReport.
<p>
  The following lines apply to both functions and expressions.

<p>
  JFreeReport supports 2 kinds of user defined calculations: Functions are statefull
  calculations, when the report proceedes they change their state, they sum up, calculate
  averages, count etc. Statefull means in that case, given you feed the same event
  multiple times into the function,you are not guaranteed to get the same result.

<p>
  Expressions in contrast do not maintain a state, they calculate a value or change
  the report-elements depending on the current Event feed to them. If you feed the
  same Event into the Expression multiple times, you will always get the same result.

<p>
  Common to both variants is: Data is fed into the function/expression by using a
  DataRow object. This object provides the (among others) these methods
<ul>
  <li><code>Object get(String name);</code>
  <li><code>Object get(int columnName);</code>
</ul>
to read the values of a function, expression, a column from the tablemodel or a
ReportProperty.
<p>
  Expressions are simple and easily explained: Expression have the method

<p>
  <code>Object getValue()</code> which is called when the expression is queried.
  All expression have to override this method to perform the calculation and to return
  the value.

<p>
  Functions are more complex:<br>
  Functions have several notification methods, where the system informs the function
  that a new event is processed.
<ul>
  <li><code>public void pageStarted (ReportEvent event);</code>
  <li><code>public void reportStarted (ReportEvent event);</code>
  <li><code>public void groupStarted (ReportEvent event);</code>
  <li><code>public void itemsStarted (ReportEvent event);</code>
  <li><code>public void itemsAdvanced (ReportEvent event);</code>
  <li><code>public void itemsFinished (ReportEvent event);</code>
  <li><code>public void groupFinished (ReportEvent event);</code>
  <li><code>public void reportFinished (ReportEvent event);</code>
  <li><code>public void pageFinished (ReportEvent event);</code>
</ul>
By using the Event-object, you have access to the ReportState. The state can be
used for getting the current group, current item and for gaining access to the
dataRow. In case you want to manipulate the ReportElements, you also have access
to the JFreeReport object.
<p>
  Functions live in an own environment, separated from the outside world. Changing
  the original JFreeReport object does not affect the inner JFreeReport-Object. You
  are also unable to add new Functions or expressions to the report from inside, so
  all functions and expression have to be set before the report processing has begun.

<p>
  All Functions have to be cloneable. It is not guaranteed that the report is processed
  in an linear order, but it is guaranteed that a single instance of a function does
  pass a reportstate only once.

<p>
  That means: When processing the report, the system clones the functions on certain
  save-points (for instance whenever a page is finished). This saved copy can later
  be used to restart the report processing on that saved point. The copy-state made
  will never return to a previous save point, but it can (and certainly will occur)
  that this copy is used to process the report from that saved point on.

<p>
  So when saving a state after page 2, it will never happen, that this page-2-copy gets
  used to process page 2 a second time, but it could happen that copies of this
  page-2-state process the page 3 again and again.

<p>
  The best way to avoid cloning problems is to use Unmodifiable objects or primitive
  datatypes when storing a state. Using java.lang.String, one of the <code>java.lang.Number</code>
  implementers or any other unmodifiable object type is always save. If you use complex
  objects, lists or hashtables and you get weird results, try to implement a
  deep-object-copy in the <code>clone()</code> method of the function for these objects.

<p>
  Using the functions

<p>
  The function implementation is loaded via its default constructor by the report
  parser, all function implementations which should be used from within the
  xml-definitions must define a public default constructor.
  The functions implementation is defined by specifiying the "class" attribute of the
  "function" tag and is loaded by using the default class loader. Your function
  implementation must be in the classloaders classpath.

<p>
  As with every function, a single function can return one value, something
  mathematicans express like y = f(x) where x is the data from your report processing.

<p>
  A function is called several times, for every state change (whenever the report
  advances) one of the ReportListener methods are called (reportStarted, groupStarted
  etc). Expressions do not receive events, they just perform their computations based
  on the current state.

<p>
  The functions value is returned by the "getValue()" function. You can return any
  Object, but make sure, that this object does not get modified anymore after it was
  returned to the caller. (A simple way to obey to this rule is to create a new object
  whenever the computed object changes).

<p>
  Functions may reuse results from other functions by using and querying the DataRow
  object supplied in the report state or the function.

<p>
  The order of the functions and the order for receiving events is undefined for
  functions of the same dependency level. So if you define a function which reads
  values from an other function, it is wise to define the dependencies for these
  functions.

<p>
  Defining dependencies is easy: A function with an higher dependency is called
  before any function with a lower dependency. By default all user functions have
  the dependency of "0", the lowest possible level. The dependency is defined by
  specifying the "deplevel" attribute of the function or expression tag.

<p>
  When using the API, the dependency level is read by "getDependencyLevel()" and can
  be set with "setDependencyLevel(int)".

<p>
  For the example above, the caller function would have the dependency level of '0'
  and the called function the level of '1' or higher.

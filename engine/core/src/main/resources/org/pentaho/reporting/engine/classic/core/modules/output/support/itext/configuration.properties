# Defines, whether and how to register the fonts installed on that system.
# This will search the installed fonts on well-known locations based on the
# detected system environment.
#
# Lazy font registration will defer the registration process until the
# font factory is first used. If the registration is defined to happen
# on init, the fonts will be registered as soon as the module get active
# for the first time.
#
# The automatic registration can be disabled by setting this configuration
# entry to "never". You will have to register the fonts manually before
# you start the output, or TrueType fonts will not be available.
#
# Valid values are "onInit", "never" or "lazy".

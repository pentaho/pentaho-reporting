  Common base classes for the table style output targets.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>
  The TableExports add several restrictions to the report layouts.
</p>

<p>
  Report elements must not overlay each other. It is ok for bands,
  but the actual data must never overlap. Once a cell is occupied,
  it cannot be redefined to contain data from other elements.
  CellData cannot be combined.
</p>

<p>
  Backgrounds can only be defined for the complete cell.
</p>

<h3>How does the table export work?</h3>

<p>
  All table targets use a two step process to create the output. In
  the first step, the layout is computed and styles information is collected.
  The style information will later be reused to form cascading stylesheets
  or to fill the Excel style tables.
</p>

<p>
  Cell backgrounds are computed during the pagination phase and are stored
  in the SheetLayout; The content itself is only stored during the content-generation
  phase and is held in the TableContentProducer. Once the page is completed
  the computed content and the sheet-layout instace are forwarded to the
  Output-processor implementations.

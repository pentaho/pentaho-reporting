<b>DEPRECATED</b> The XML output generates a xml representation of the generated output. This example
is a small educational outputtarget, to show the global concepts of the OutputProcess.
It is kept small and simple.
<p>
  The target consists of 2 parts. The <strong>XMLProcessor</strong> is used to prepare the report and
  to initialize the <strong>XMLWriter</strong>.

<p>

<h3>The XMLProcessor</h3>
The XMLProcessor instantiates the XMLWriter. The Processor is also used to repaginate
the report; this is the report preparation process which calculates function values and
resolves function dependencies. Finally, the last report processing run activates the
XMLWriter, which writes the generated output to a java.io.Writer.
<h3>The XMLWriter</h3>
The XMLWriter is a report function. For every received event, the to be printed band is
simply written as XML-Stream.

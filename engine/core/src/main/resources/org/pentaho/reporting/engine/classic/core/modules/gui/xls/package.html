<p>
  An excel export module. The module registers itself during the module initialization
  in the preview frame.
</p>

<p>
  The export is done using the Apache POI library. This library does not support
  images.
</p>

<p>
  As with all table style exports, this target does not support overlapping elements.
  If two elements request the same cell, the first element wins.

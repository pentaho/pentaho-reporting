Classes for reading XML-based report definitions.
<p>
  At the moment two report definition formats are supported,
  the simple profile is a simplified model of the report definition.
  Although it does not support all advanced features, its simple
  structure helps to understand the basic report process and makes
  it possible to easily write report definitions.

<p>
  The second parser uses a more complex model, which describes the
  report is a very detailed way. Due to the low level orientation of
  the report definition format, writing report definition is more
  complicated and requires detailed knowledge of the object structures
  used in JFreeReport. Its more generalized structure allows to define
  every aspect of the report definition and makes it possible to use
  all implemented features of JFreeReport.

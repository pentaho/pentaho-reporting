# Defines that the Graphics2D and PDF output will ignore the regular border
# and background definitions. The output target will draw debugging borders
# instead, which can be used to visualize the internal structure of the output.

# Defines, that the output target will dump the currently processed page to
# the log system. This is expensive and creates huge amounts of data. It only
# makes sense to activate this property, if you are debugging the report layout
# system. For everyone else, activating this property will result in a enormous
# slow-down.

# Defines, whether the watermark section will be printed by the report processor.
# This setting is usually configured on the report level, not globally.
# A printing target might use this setting do disable printing of the the form layout
# when printing on form-paper.

#
# Defines in which resolution the generated images should be printed. If the image
# is not available in a suitable size for the given layouted output size, the image
# will be scaled to fit the specified device resolution.
#
# For the sake of backward compatibility, we define the device resolution to be
# 72 DPI. This way, a pixel equals a point in the rendering.

#
# Defines, whether scaling should use the device's native scaling, which may or may
# not produce sensible results, or whether the images should be pre-scaled using a
# internal image scaling algorithm.
#
# This defaults to "false" so that we can guarantee the same output quality in all cases.

#
# Defines whether the renderer installs a relaxed clipping region around drawables. If set to false,
# the clipping area will be expanded by 0.5 points to allow operations directly on the clipping boundary
# to succeed. If your drawable rendering seems to overlap with adjacent borders, and you don't want that,
# set this property to 'true'.
#
# This property defaults to true to allow more freedom for drawable authors by default.

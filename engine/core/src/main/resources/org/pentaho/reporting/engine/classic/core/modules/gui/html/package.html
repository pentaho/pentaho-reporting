<p>
  An HTML export module. The module registers itself during the module initialization
  in the preview frame.
</p>

<p>
  The module supports both HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 output.
</p>

<p>
  As with all table style exports, this target does not support overlapping elements.
  If two elements request the same cell, the first element wins.
</p>

<p>
  This target supports three modes.
<ul>
  <li>Stream mode
    <p>prints all content into a single stream. Generated images will be
      ignored and the stream contains an inlined stylesheet definition. External
      images loaded by an file or http url will be referenced in the stream,
      all other internally generated image content will be discarded.
    </p>
  <li>Directory export
    <p>
      Writes the content and all external content into a directory. The report
      contents will be written into a single file, while any external content
      will be written into a separate data directory. This output mode will
      generate PNG files for all internal images; external images can be copied
      into the output directory.
    </p>
  <li>ZIP Directory export
    <p>
      Provides the same features as the directory export, but will generate the
      contents within a ZIP file.
    </p>
</ul>

The {@link org.jfree.xml.factory.objects.ClassFactory}
interface and related classes.
<p>
  The {@link org.jfree.xml.factory.objects.ClassFactory} and the
  {@link org.jfree.xml.factory.objects.ObjectDescription} are used to descripe,
  generate and serialize objects in a generalized way.

<p>
  ObjectDescriptions are used to descripe the properties of an object. The properties can
  either be an primitive object (String, Long, Integer, Short, Byte, Character, Boolean) or
  an compound object. Compound objects may have other primitive or compound objects defined
  as properties.

<p>
  You may use the ObjectReferenceGenerator to create the Reference-Documentation for all
  known Object-Description implementations.

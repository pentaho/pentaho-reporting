<p>
  An CSV export module. The module registers itself during the module initialization
  in the preview frame.
</p>

<p>
  The module contains support for raw and layouted csv exports. In the
  raw mode, the current data row will be written to the file, while the layouted
  mode tries to preserve the layout in the exported file.
</p>

<p>
  As with all table style exports, this target does not support overlapping elements.
  If two elements request the same cell, the first element wins.
</p>

<p>
  For best layouted results, you should use the excel export target.

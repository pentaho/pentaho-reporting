# Table target configuration properties ...

#
# Defines whether a stricter, but more accurate layout algorithm should
# be applied. Setting this property to false will greatly reduce the table
# complexity.
#
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.base.StrictLayout=false

#
# Defines, whether the table-export should also print the pagebands and
# repeated group header and footer.
#
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.base.UsePageBands=true

#
# Defines, whether the table writer will print debug messages listing all
# overlapping elements and commit points. This requires the reporting engine
# to maintain additional data-structures which consume a large amount of memory
# and are expensive in both computation time and memory usage.
# The messages are very detailed and therefore great to debug report definitions,
#
# Due to the high costs, this property should be disabled in production
# environments. However, as this is the only way for new users to tell why
# table-reports seem to ignore elements due to overlaps, this property is set
# to true by default.  
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.base.ReportCellConflicts=false

#
# Defines whether table exports will report an hard error (and abort the report
# processing) when cells overlap. This property is useful when loosing content
# is not an option.
#
# This defaults to false to not break existing reports that may now fail otherwise.
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.base.FailOnCellConflicts=false

#
# Defines, whether the table-laoyuter will create extensive debugging logs.
# This is a great help for debugging the layouter, but should be left disabled
# by default, as it greatly slows down the report processing. 
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.base.DebugReportLayout=false

#
# Defines, whether the cell-markers used to track occupied cells should contain
# detailed information about the repot elements contained in the cells. If set to
# false, it will not be possible to tell what element participate in the
# overlap conflict. To ease debugging, this property is set to true by default.
#
# Verbose cell-markers are expensive, so you might want to disable them in production
# environments.

#
# Defines whether elipse-shapes are treated as if they are ordinary rectangles, so
# that they end up as background for a cell.
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.base.TreatEllipseAsRectangle=false

#
# Defines that a faster algorithm is used to compute cell backgrounds. In rare cases when
# you combine subreports with legacy elements like lines and rectangles this algorithm may
# not calculate the border regions correctly.
#
# Defaults to "true" as you should not use legacy elements extensively anyway.

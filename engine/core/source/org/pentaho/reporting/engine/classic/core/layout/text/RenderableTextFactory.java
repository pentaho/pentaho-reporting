/**
 * Problem: Text may span more than one chunk, and text may influence the break behaviour of the next chunk.
 * <p/>
 * Possible solution: TextFactory does not return the complete text. It returns the text up to the last whitespace
 * encountered and returns the text chunk only if either finishText has been called or some more text comes in. The ugly
 * sideffect: Text may result in more than one renderable text chunk returned.
 * <p/>
 * If we return lines (broken by an LineBreak-occurence) we can safe us a lot of trouble later.

/**
 * The interface for report functions.  A report function separates the business logic from presentation of the result.
 * The function is called whenever JFreeReport changes its state while generating the report. The working model for the
 * functions is based on cloning the state of the function on certain checkpoints to support the ReportState
 * implementation of JFreeReport.
 * <p/>
 * Although functions support the ReportListener interface, they are not directly added to a report. A report
 * FunctionCollection is used to control the functions. Functions are required to be cloneable.

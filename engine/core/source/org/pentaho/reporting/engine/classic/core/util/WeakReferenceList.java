/**
 * The WeakReference list uses <code>java.lang.ref.WeakReference</code>s to store its contents. In contrast to the
 * WeakHashtable, this list knows how to restore missing content, so that garbage collected elements can be restored
 * when they are accessed.
 * <p/>
 * By default this list can contain 25 elements, where the first element is stored using a strong reference, which is
 * not garbage collected.
 * <p/>
 * Restoring the elements is not implemented, concrete implementations will have to override the
 * <code>restoreChild(int)</code> method. The <code>getMaxChildCount</code> method defines the maxmimum number of
 * children in the list. When more than <code>maxChildCount</code> elements are contained in this list, add will always
 * return false to indicate that adding the element failed.
 * <p/>
 * To customize the list, override createReference to create a different kind of reference.
 * <p/>
 * This list is able to add or replace elements, but inserting or removing of elements is not possible.

   * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning of "copy" may depend on the class of the object.
   * The general intent is that, for any object <tt>x</tt>, the expression: <blockquote>
   * <pre>
   * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
   * will be true, and that the expression: <blockquote>
   * <pre>
   * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
   * will be <tt>true</tt>, but these are not absolute requirements. While it is typically the case that: <blockquote>
   * <pre>
   * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
   * will be <tt>true</tt>, this is not an absolute requirement.
   * <p/>
   * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling <tt>super.clone</tt>.  If a class and all of its
   * superclasses (except <tt>Object</tt>) obey this convention, it will be the case that <tt>x.clone().getClass() ==
   * x.getClass()</tt>.
   * <p/>
   * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent of this object (which is being cloned).  To
   * achieve this independence, it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by
   * <tt>super.clone</tt> before returning it.  Typically, this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the
   * internal "deep structure" of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references
   * to the copies.  If a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
   * the case that no fields in the object returned by <tt>super.clone</tt> need to be modified.
   * <p/>
   * The method <tt>clone</tt> for class <tt>Object</tt> performs a specific cloning operation. First, if the class of
   * this object does not implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>, then a <tt>CloneNotSupportedException</tt> is
   * thrown. Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>. Otherwise, this method
   * creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the
   * corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned.
   * Thus, this method performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
   * <p/>
   * The class <tt>Object</tt> does not itself implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>, so calling the <tt>clone</tt>
   * method on an object whose class is <tt>Object</tt> will result in throwing an exception at run time.
   *
   * @return a clone of this instance.
   * @throws CloneNotSupportedException if the object's class does not support the <code>Cloneable</code> interface.
   *                                    Subclasses that override the <code>clone</code> method can also throw this
   *                                    exception to indicate that an instance cannot be cloned.

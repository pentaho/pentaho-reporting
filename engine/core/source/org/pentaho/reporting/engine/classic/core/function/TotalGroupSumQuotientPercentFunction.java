/**
 * A report function that calculates the quotient of two summed fields (columns) from the data-row. This function
 * produces a global total. The total sum of the group is known when the group processing starts and the report is not
 * performing a prepare-run. The sum is calculated in the prepare run and recalled in the printing run.
 * <p/>
 * The function can be used in two ways: <ul> <li>to calculate a quotient for the entire report;</li> <li>to calculate a
 * quotient within a particular group;</li> </ul> This function expects its input values to be either java.lang.Number
 * instances or Strings that can be parsed to java.lang.Number instances using a java.text.DecimalFormat.
 * <p/>
 * The function undestands three parameters. The <code>dividend</code> parameter is required and denotes the name of an
 * ItemBand-field which gets summed up as dividend. The <code>divisor</code> parameter is required and denotes the name
 * of an ItemBand-field which gets summed up as divisor.
 * <p/>
 * The parameter <code>group</code> denotes the name of a group. When this group is started, the counter gets reseted to
 * null. This parameter is optional.
 * <p/>
 * This function scales the computed percentage to 100. A value of 100% will therefore be returned as 100 instead of 1.
 * The result of this function cannot be used together with the percentage operator of the NumberFormat in a
 * Number-field.

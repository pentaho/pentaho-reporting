 * A logical page definition for a report.
 * <p/>
 * Page oriented reports use the page definition to distribute the content of one logical page to the physical pages.
 * The order of the physical pages in the page definition defines the content order in the generated documents.
 * <p/>
 * Flow oriented reports will use the page-definitions width as default width for the layouting.
 * <p/>
 * If a logical page is completly empty, it will be removed from the report and a pageCanceled event is fired. If a
 * physical page within a non empty logical page is empty, if depends on the ReportProcessor whether the page is printed
 * as empty page or whether it will be removed from the report.
 * <p/>
 * Areas of the logical page not covered by the physical pages will not cause errors, the content in these areas will be
 * ignored and not printed.
 * <p/>
 * Page definitions must not be changed during the report processing, or funny things will happen.

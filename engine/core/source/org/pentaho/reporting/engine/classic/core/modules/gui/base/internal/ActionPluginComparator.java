   * Compares its two arguments for order.  Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first
   * argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.<p>
   * <p/>
   * The implementor must ensure that <tt>sgn(compare(x, y)) == -sgn(compare(y, x))</tt> for all <tt>x</tt> and
   * <tt>y</tt>.  (This implies that <tt>compare(x, y)</tt> must throw an exception if and only if <tt>compare(y,
   * x)</tt> throws an exception.)<p>
   * <p/>
   * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive: <tt>((compare(x, y)&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (compare(y,
   * z)&gt;0))</tt> implies <tt>compare(x, z)&gt;0</tt>.<p>
   * <p/>
   * Finally, the implementer must ensure that <tt>compare(x, y)==0</tt> implies that <tt>sgn(compare(x,
   * z))==sgn(compare(y, z))</tt> for all <tt>z</tt>.<p>
   * <p/>
   * It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that <tt>(compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</tt>.
   * Generally speaking, any comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.  The recommended
   * language is "Note: this comparator imposes orderings that are inconsistent with equals."
   *
   * @param ap1 the first object to be compared.
   * @param ap2 the second object to be compared.
   * @return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater
   *         than the second.
   * @throws ClassCastException if the arguments' types prevent them from being compared by this Comparator.

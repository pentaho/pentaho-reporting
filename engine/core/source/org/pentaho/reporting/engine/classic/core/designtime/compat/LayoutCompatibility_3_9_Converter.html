  <h2>Layout-Property migration from Pentaho Reporting 3.8.3 or older to Pentaho Reporting 3.9.0</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    This migration removes all existing widow and orphan properties that may be defined on any of the
    report elements. The widow/orphan settings were not working on 3.8 version of Pentaho reporting.
    This migration also removes all keep-together flags from non-bands, like groups and report objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Control elements, like groups, group-body and the master-report object, that have any of the width or
    height properties defined, have these properties cleared during the migration. The old versions of
    the reporting system ignored these properties, while newer versions honour those properties.

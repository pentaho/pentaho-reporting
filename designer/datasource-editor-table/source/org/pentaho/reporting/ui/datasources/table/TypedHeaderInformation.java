  /**
   * Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the
   * <code>toString</code> method returns a string that
   * "textually represents" this object. The result should
   * be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a
   * person to read.
   * It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
   * <p/>
   * The <code>toString</code> method for class <code>Object</code>
   * returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
   * object is an instance, the at-sign character `<code>@</code>', and
   * the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
   * object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
   * value of:
   * <blockquote>
   * <pre>
   * getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
   * </pre></blockquote>
   *
   * @return a string representation of the object.

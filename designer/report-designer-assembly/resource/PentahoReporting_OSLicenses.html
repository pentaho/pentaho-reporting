SOFTWARE RIGHTS
<P>
ANTLR 1989-2004 Developed by Terence Parr
Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com
<P>
We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.
<P>
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
incorporate any source code into one of your programs
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
system and expect to make other tools available as they are
completed.

applicable version of this License or the recipients
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.

behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You

STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER

<li> U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</li>
<p>
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
Government rights in computer software under this License.
    </p>
<li> MISCELLANEOUS.</li>
    <p>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
United States export administration regulations (and the export
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    </p>
<li> RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</li>
    <p>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
of liability.

<br><br>
<p>6.  TERMINATION.</p><ul>
6.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.  Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the  termination of this License shall survive.<br><br>
6.2.  <a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory  judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the  Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim  is referred to as &ldquo;Participant&rdquo;) alleging that the Participant  Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a  Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the  Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then  any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such  Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not  the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2  of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate  prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day  notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your  claim with respect to the Participant Software against such  Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement  with Participant.<br><br>

This U.S.  Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other  FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government  rights in computer software under this License.</p>
<br><br>
<p>9.  MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This  License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,  such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make  it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the  jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original  Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides  otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the  jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with  the losing party responsible for costs, including, without  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be  construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

<br><br>
<p>10.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>

<tt>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</tt> <br><br>
1. DEFINITIONS <br><br>
</b>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:<br><br>
<dl>
<dd>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and <br><br>

<dd>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br><br>

<dd>i) changes to the Program, and<br><br>

<dd>ii) additions to the Program;<br><br>

<dd>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br><br>

</dl><a name="distributorExcludeDamagesRestrictionLicense1">&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program</a>. <br><br>
&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br><br>
&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. <br><br>
&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. <br><br>
<b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br><br>
</b><a name="feeForSoftwareRestrictionLicense1"></a>
<dl>
<dd>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, <a name="returnAddedCodeRestrictionLicense"><a name="feeForDistributionRestrictionLicense">each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free </a> copyright <a name="copyRestrictionLicense">license to reproduce,</a> <a name="modificationRestrictionLicense">prepare derivative works of,</a> publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.</a><br><br>

<dd>b) <a name="feeForSoftwareRestrictionLicense2">Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</a> <a name="expressPatentLicenseRestrictionLicense">patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br><br>

<dd>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</a><br><br>

<dd><a name="IPWarrantRestrictionLicense">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</a><br><br>

</dl>3. REQUIREMENTS</b> <br><br>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br><br>

<dd>b) its license agreement:<br><br>

<dd>i) <a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense1">effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; <br><br></a>

<dd>ii) <a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense1"></a>effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; <br><br>

<dd>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and <br><br>

<dd>iv) <a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense1">states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange</a>. <br><br>

</dl><a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense"><a name="includeLicenseRestrictionLicense">When the Program is made available in source code form:<br><br>

<dl>
<dd>a) it must be made available under this Agreement</a>; and<br><br>

<dd>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program</a>. <br><br>

</dl>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<br><br>
<a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</a> <br><br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b> <br><br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense">Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.</a> The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. <br><br>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. <br><br>
5. <a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense2">NO WARRANTY<br><br>
</b>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. </a><br><br>
<a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense2">6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY <br><br>
</b>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
<a name="distributorExcludeDamagesRestrictionLicense2">NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </a>
</a><br><br>
7. GENERAL<br><br>
</b>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. <br><br>
<a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</a><br><br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. <br><br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. <br><br>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<br>

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from <a name="usageLevelLicense">and are distributed by that particular Contributor</a>. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. <a name="joinLevelLicense">Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.</a>
</p><p>
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
</p><p>
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
</p><p>
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
</p><p>
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
</p><p>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
</p><p>
<a name="returnAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">a)</a> Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, <a name="feeForSoftwareRestrictionLicense">royalty-free copyright license</a> <a name="copyRestrictionLicense">to reproduce</a>, <a name="modificationRestrictionLicense">prepare derivative works of</a>, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
</p><p>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, <a name="expressPatentLicenseRestrictionLicense">each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</a>
</p><p>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
</p><p>
d) <a name="IPWarrantRestrictionLicense">Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</a>
</p><p>
3. REQUIREMENTS
</p><p>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
</p><p>
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
</p><p>
b) its license agreement:
</p><p>
i) <a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense">effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</a>
</p><p>
ii) <a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</a>
</p><p>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
</p><p>
<a name="openSourceAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">iv)</a> <a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</a>
</p><p>
When the Program is made available in source code form:
</p><p>
<a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">a) it must be made available under this Agreement;</a> and
</p><p>
b) <a name="includeLicenseRestrictionLicense">a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</a>
</p><p>
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
</p><p>
<a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</a>
</p><p>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
</p><p>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense">if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.</a> The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
</p><p>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
</p><p>
5. NO WARRANTY
</p><p>
<a name="distributorDisclaimerRestrictionLicense">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</a>
</p><p>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
</p><p>
<a name="distributorExcludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</a>
</p><p>
7. GENERAL
</p><p>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
</p><p>
<a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</a>
</p><p>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
</p><p>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
</p><p>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

<h1>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h1>
<p>Version 3,&nbsp;&nbsp;29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
&lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</p><p>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

<h4>0. Additional Definitions.</h4>

<p>As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU
Lesser
General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to version 3 of
the GNU
General Public License.</p>

<p><a name="joinLevelLicense">&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</a></p>

<p><a name="joinLevelLicense2">An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface
provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.</a></p>

<p><a name="joinLevelLicense3">A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked
Version&rdquo;.</a></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means
the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

<h4>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h4>

<p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

<h4>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h4>

<p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>

<li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4>

<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.</li>

<li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Combined Works.</h4>

<p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.</li>

<li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.</li>

<li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>

<li>d) Do one of the following:

<ul>
<li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.</li>

<li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Combined Libraries.</h4>

<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>

<li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</p>

<h1>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h1>
<p>Version 3,&nbsp;&nbsp;29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
&lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</p><p>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.</p>

<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</p>

<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</p>

<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>

<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<h4>0. Definitions.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>


<p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;. 
&ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of
the
earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work
based
on the Program.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables
other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

<p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal
Notices&rdquo;
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

<h4>1. Source Code.</h4>

<p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the
work
for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
form of a work.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an
official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything,
other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential
component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means
all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</p>

<h4>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

<p><a name="copyRestrictionLicense">You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</a></p>

<p><a name="copyRestrictionLicense2">Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</a></p>

<h4>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>

<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</p>

<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</p>

<h4>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and <a name="includeLicenseRestrictionLicense">give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</a></p>

<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

<h4>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, <a name="modificationRestrictionLicense">or the modifications to
produce it from the Program</a>, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) <a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.</a></li>

<li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li>

<li>c) <a name="returnAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.</a>  <a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.</a>  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

<li>d) <a name="runtimeNoticeRestrictionLicense">If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</p>

<h4>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>

<p><a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.</li>

<li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

<li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.</li>

<li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

<li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.</li>
</ul>

<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;,
which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p>

<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</p>

<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</p>

<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

<h4>7. Additional Terms.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of
this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

<li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

<li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

<li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or</li>

<li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

<li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.</li>
</ul>

<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</p>

<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</p>

<h4>8. Termination.</h4>

<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</p>

<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</p>

<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</p>

<h4>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

<h4>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>

<p><a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense2">Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license</a> from the original licensors, to run, <a name="modificationRestrictionLicense">modify</a> and
propagate that work, <a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense3">subject to this License.</a>  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

<p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of
an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

<p><a name="discriminationRestrictionLicense">You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.</a>  <a name="feeForSoftwareRestrictionLicense">For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License</a>, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

<h4>11. Patents.</h4>

<p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor
version&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</p>

<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any
express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to
a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</p>

<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you
have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>


<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</p>

<p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include
within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

<h4>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

<h4>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.</p>

<h4>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.</p>

<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.</p>

<h4>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT
WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

<h4>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>

<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<h4>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>

<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.</p>

<pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
</pre>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<pre>    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</pre>

<p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &ldquo;about
box&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if
necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</p>

<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p>
    <blockquote>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be
        made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of
        this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
        Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
        in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.2. Modifications.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
        License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
        sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.3. Required Notices.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of
        the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within
        the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
        Contributor or the Initial Developer.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
        restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
        offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
        recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
        Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
        result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or
        under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
        that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
        not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
        this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
        make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
        Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
        for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
        offer.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.6. Larger Works.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms
        of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
        requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
    </blockquote>
    <p>4. Versions of the License.</p>
    <blockquote>4.1. New Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
        from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
        4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
        the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
        Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
        otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received
        the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license
        steward.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4.3. Modified Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,
        You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
        references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
        and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
    </blockquote>
    <p>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
            KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
            IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
            THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
            DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
            OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
            DISCLAIMER.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>6. TERMINATION.</p>
    <blockquote>6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
        comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
        survive.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
        Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim
        is referred to as &ldquo;Participant&rdquo;) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
        Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
        Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
        indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
        from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,
        unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against
        such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant
        Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
        settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
        licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
        the amount or value of any payment or license.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have
        been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to
        You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
    </blockquote>
    <p>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
            OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
            SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
            INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
            GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
            LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION
            OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
            NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
            EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Covered Software is a &ldquo;commercial item,&rdquo; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
            1995), consisting of &ldquo;commercial computer software&rdquo; (as that term is defined at 48
            C.F.R. &sect; 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &ldquo;commercial computer software documentation&rdquo; as such
            terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
            227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with
            only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
            any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
            under this License.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
            License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
            make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
            otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
            License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue

<dl>
<dd>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>

<dd>59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>

<dd>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>

<dd>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br>

<dd>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br>

<dd>as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>

<dd>the version number 2.1.]<br><br>
<br>

</dl><h2>Preamble</h2>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. <br><br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. <br><br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br><br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. <br><br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br><br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br><br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. <br><br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. <br><br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. <br><br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. <br><br>
We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. <br><br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. <br><br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br><br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. <br><br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. <br><br>
<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h2><b>0.</b> This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>
A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. <br><br>
The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) <br><br>
&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br><br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. <br><br>
<b>1.</b> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br><br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. <br><br>
<b>2.</b> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: <br><br>
<dl>
<dd>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. <br><br>

<dd>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>

<dd>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. <br><br>

<dd>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. <br><br>

<dd>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) <br><br>

<dd>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. <br><br>

<dd>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. <br><br>

<dd>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. <br><br>

</dl>3.</b> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. <br><br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br><br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. <br><br>
4.</b> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. <br><br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>
5.</b> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. <br><br>
However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. <br><br>
When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br><br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) <br><br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br><br>
6.</b> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. <br><br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) <br><br>

<dd>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. <br><br>

<dd>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. <br><br>

<dd>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. <br><br>

<dd>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br>

</dl>For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br><br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. <br><br>
7.</b> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. <br><br>

<dd>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>

</dl>8.</b> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. <br><br>
9.</b> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. <br><br>
10.</b> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. <br><br>
11.</b> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. <br><br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. <br><br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. <br><br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. <br><br>
12.</b> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br><br>
13.</b> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. <br><br>
14.</b> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. <br><br>
NO WARRANTY <br><br>
15. </b>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br><br>
16.</b> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br><br>
<h2>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</h2>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). <br><br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.<br>

<dd>Copyright (C) year name of author <br><br>

<dd>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>

<dd>modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>

<dd>License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>

<dd>version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br>

<dd>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>

<dd>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>

<dd>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>

<dd>Lesser General Public License for more details.<br><br>

<dd>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>

<dd>License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>

</dl>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. <br><br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: <br><br>

 </li></ol>

 <h2>3. Distribution Obligations.</h2>

 <h3>3.1. Application of License.</h3>

 <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms

  of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. <a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">The

  Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed</a> only under the terms of this License

  or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1,

  and <a name="includeLicenseRestrictionLicense">You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You

  distribute.</a> <a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or

  restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.</a>

  However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in

  Section 3.5.

 </p><h3>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</h3>

 <p><a name="returnAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in

  Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable

  version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an

  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,

  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became

  available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular

  Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring

  that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution

  Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</a>

 </p><h3>3.3. Description of Modifications.</h3>

 <p><a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the

  changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a

  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original

  Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in

  (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation

  in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</a>

 </p><h3>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h3>

 <h4>(a) Third Party Claims</h4>

 <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property

  rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections

  2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a

  text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the

  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If

  Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in

  Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in

  all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as

  notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who

  received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

 </p><h4>(b) Contributor APIs</h4>

 <p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor

  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that

  <abbr>API</abbr>, Contributor must also include this information in the

  <strong>legal</strong> file.

 </p><h4>(c) Representations.</h4>

 <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4

  (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications

  are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the

  rights conveyed by this License.

 </p><h3>3.5. Required Notices.</h3>

 <p><a name="runtimeNoticeRestrictionLicense">You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the

  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to

  its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)

  where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more

  Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in

  Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation

  for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to

  Covered Code.</a> <a name="feeForSoftwareRestrictionLicense">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity

  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so

  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You

  must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability

  obligation is offered by You alone</a>, and <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense1">You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer

  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor

  as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</a>

 </p><h3>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</h3>

 <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections

  3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and <a name="runtimeNoticeRestrictionLicense">if You include a

  notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms

  of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations

  of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any

  notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe

  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code.</a> You may distribute the Executable version of

  Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms

  different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this

  License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the

  recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If

  You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely

  clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the

  Initial Developer or any Contributor. <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense2">You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and

  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as

  a result of any such terms You offer.</a>

 </p><h3>3.7. Larger Works.</h3>

 <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the

  terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,

  You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

 </p><h2>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h2>

 <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to

  some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:

  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe

  the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the

  <strong>legal</strong> file described in Section

  3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.

  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be

  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

 </p><h2>5. Application of this License.</h2>

 <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in

  Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

 </p><h2>6. Versions of the License.</h2>

 <h3>6.1. New Versions</h3>

 <p>MonetDB B.V. may publish revised and/or new versions

  of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

 </p><h3>6.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>

 <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may

  always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such

  Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by MonetDB B.V..

  No one other than MonetDB B.V. has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code

  created under this License.

 </p><h3>6.3. Derivative Works</h3>

 <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only

do in order to

 apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)

 rename Your license so that the phrases "MonetDB"

 or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that

 your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of

 the license contains terms which differ from the MonetDB Public License.

 (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the

 notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to

 be modifications of this License.)

 </p><h2>7. <strong>Disclaimer of warranty</strong></h2>

 <p><strong>Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is"

  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without

  limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a

  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of

  the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you

  (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary

  servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part

  of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this

  disclaimer.</strong>

 </p><h2>8. Termination</h2>

 <p>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate

  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach

  within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which

  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by

  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

 </p><p>8.2. <a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement

  claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor

  (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to

  as "Participant") alleging that:

 </p><ol type="a">

  <li>such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly

   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under

   Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this

   License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if

   within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay

   Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of

   Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with

   respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of

   notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in

   writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by

   Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or

   2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day

   notice period specified above.

  </li><li>any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's

   Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights

   granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)

   and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first

   made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

 </li></ol>

 <p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant

  alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes

  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the

  initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses

  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or

  2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or

  value of any payment or license.</a>

 </p><p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections

  8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user

  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly

  granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive

  termination.

 </p><h2>9. <strong>Limitation of liability</strong></h2>

 <p><strong>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether

  tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer,

  any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of

  such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or

  consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss

  of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other

  commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the

  possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability

  for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent

  applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion

  or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation

  may not apply to you.</strong>

 </p><h2>10. U.S. government end users</h2>

 <p>The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48

  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of

  "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such

  terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.

  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.

  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users

  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

 </p><h2>11. Miscellaneous</h2>

 <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If

  any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be

  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be

  governed by the laws of The Netherlands and You hereby irrevocably

  agree that the Courts of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, are to have

  jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in

  connection with this License. The application of the United

  Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly

  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract

  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

 </p><h2>12. Responsibility for claims</h2>

 <p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for

  claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights

  under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to

  distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or

  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

 </p><h2>13. Multiple-licensed code</h2>

 <p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as

  "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits

  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the

  MonetDB Public License

  or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file

  described in Exhibit A.

<br><br>
</ul>
</ul><b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b>
<ul>
<b>3.1. Application of License.</b>
<a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
this License, including without limitation Section <b>2.2</b>.</a> The Source Code version of
Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
this License released under Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a copy of this License
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on
any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or
the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering
the additional rights described in Section <b>3.5</b>. <br><br>
<b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b>
<a name="openSourceAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism
is maintained by a third party.</a> <br><br>
<b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b>
<a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
(a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</a> <br><br>
<b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</b>
<ul>
<a name="IPWarrantRestrictionLicense"><b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>.
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property
rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
&quot;LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
obtained. </a><br><br>
<b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>.
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor
has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
&nbsp;
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Representations.</b>
<ul>
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above,
Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br>
<br><br>
</ul>
<b>3.5. Required Notices.</b>
You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the Source Code.&nbsp; If
it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
would be likely to look for such a notice.&nbsp; If You created one or more Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b>.&nbsp;
You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.&nbsp; You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
offered by You alone, and <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense">You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</a> <br><br>
<b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b>
<a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
<b>3.1-3.5</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
<b>3.2</b>.</a> The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of any such terms You offer. <br><br>
<b>3.7. Larger Works.</b>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
</ul><b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b>
<ul>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
file described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all distributions of the
Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
</ul><b>5. Application of this License.</b>
<ul>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
<b>Exhibit A</b> and to related Covered Code.
</ul><b>6. Versions of the License.</b>
<ul>
<b>6.1. New Versions</b>.
Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions
of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number. <br><br>
<b>6.2. Effect of New Versions</b>.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.
No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
created under this License. <br><br>
<b>6.3. Derivative Works</b>.
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'',
&quot;MPL&quot;, ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
(except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License
and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
Contributor in the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b> shall not of themselves be deemed to
be modifications of this License.)
</ul><b>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b>
<a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense">
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO
USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
</a><b>8. TERMINATION.</b>
<ul>
<b>8.1.&nbsp; </b>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. <br><br>
<b>8.2.&nbsp; </b><a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
&quot;Participant&quot;)&nbsp; alleging that: <br><br>
<b>(a)&nbsp; </b>such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)&nbsp; agree in writing to
pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect
to the Contributor Version against such Participant.&nbsp; If within 60 days of notice, a
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
period specified above. <br><br>
<b>(b)</b>&nbsp; any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to
You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
Participant. <br><br>
<b>8.3.&nbsp; </b>If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent
where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
or value of any payment or license.</a> <br><br>
<b>8.4.</b>&nbsp; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,&nbsp; all end
user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
</ul><b>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b>
<a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON
FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE
TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</a><b>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</b>
<ul>
The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software
documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
</ul><b>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</b>
<ul>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only
to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California
law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of
America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
</ul><b>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b>
<ul>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
constitute any admission of liability.
</ul><b>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</b>
<ul>
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.&nbsp;
Multiple-Licensedmeans that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the
Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by

The license and service term are set forth in your 
Entitlement(s). Your rights under this Agreement will 
terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you 
materially breach it or take any action in derogation 
of Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun 
may terminate this Agreement should any Software 
become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to 
become, the subject of a claim of intellectual 
property infringement or trade secret 
misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use 
of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in 
writing to Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will 
survive termination of the Agreement.
<P>
<LI>	Java Compatibility and Open Source.

open source developers, and thanks the community for 
its important contributions and open standards-based 
technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its 
products.
<P>
Please note that portions of Software may be provided 
with notices and open source licenses from such 
communities and third parties that govern the use of 
those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do 
not alter any rights and obligations you may have 
under such open source licenses, however, the 
disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability 
provisions in this Agreement will apply to all 
Software in this distribution.
<P>
<LI> 	Limited Warranty. 
<P>
Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from 
the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the 
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if

workmanship under normal use. Except for the 
foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS". Your 
exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this 
limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace 
Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. 
Some states do not allow limitations on certain 
implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. 
This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. 
You may have others, which vary from state to state.
<P>
<LI>	Disclaimer of Warranty. 
<P>
UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE 
DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID. 
<P>
<LI> 	Limitation of Liability.

negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by 
you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated 
warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states 
do not allow the exclusion of incidental or 
consequential damages, so some of the terms above may 
not be applicable to you.

  is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from
  the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor

  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices;
  or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
  absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
<P>
3. Distribution Obligations.
<P>
3.1. Application of License.
<P>
  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
  are governed by the terms of this License, including without
  limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered
  Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
  or a future version of this License released under Section
  6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every
  copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
  impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
  restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
  additional document offering the additional rights described
  in Section 3.5.
<P>
3.2. Availability of Source Code.
<P>
  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute
  must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
  this License either on the same media as an Executable version
  or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
  to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made
  available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain
  available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
  initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
  subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
  made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
  ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even
  if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
  third party.
<P>
3.3. Description of Modifications.
<P>
  You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to
  contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
  Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly
  or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
  (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
  version or related documentation in which You describe the
  origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
<P>
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
<P>
  (a) Third Party Claims.
<P>
  If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
  party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
  2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
  distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the
  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
  will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
  knowledge after the Modification is made available as
  described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
  the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
  thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
  appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
  to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
  knowledge has been obtained.
<P>
  (b) Contributor APIs.
<P>
  If Contributor's Modifications include an application
  programming interface ("API") and Contributor has knowledge of
  patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
  that API, Contributor must also include this information in
  the LEGAL file.
<P>
  (c) Representations.
<P>
  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
  Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
  Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
  Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
  by this License.
<P>
3.5. Required Notices.
<P>
  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
  particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
  must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
  directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
  notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
  add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
  Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
  documentation for the Source Code where You describe
  recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered
  Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
  or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
  Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
  clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability terms You offer.
<P>
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
<P>
  You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
  requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
  Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
  this License, including a description of how and where You
  have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
  version, related documentation or collateral in which You
  describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
  may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
  contain terms different from this License, provided that You
  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
  license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
  or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
  from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
  the Executable version under a different license You must make
  it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
  License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
  the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
  such terms You offer.
<P>
3.7. Larger Works.
<P>
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
  other code not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
  case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
  fulfilled for the Covered Code.
<P>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
<P>
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
  this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
  due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
  extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
  they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
  file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
  distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
  prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
  able to understand it.
<P>
5. Application of this License.
<P>
  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
  has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered
  Code.
<P>
6. Versions of the License.
<P>
6.1. New Versions.
<P>
  Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
  be given a distinguishing version number.
<P>
6.2. Effect of New Versions.
<P>
  Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
  version of the License, You may always continue to use it
  under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
  such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
  the License published by Sun. No one other than Sun has the
  right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
  under this License.
<P>
6.3. Derivative Works.
<P>
  If You create or use a modified version of this License (which
  you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
  already Covered Code governed by this License), You must: (a)
  rename Your license so that the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public
  License," or "SPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
  appear in your license (except to note that your license
  differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
  that Your version of the license contains terms which differ
  from the Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the
  Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
  described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
  modifications of this License.)
<P>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
<P>
  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS''
  BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
  COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
  THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
  SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
  (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
  THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
  THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
  HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
<P>
8. TERMINATION.
<P>
  8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
  terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
  herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming
  aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
  effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
<P>
  8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)
  against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
  Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is
  referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
<P>
  (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
  indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
  granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
  2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
  Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days
  after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to
  pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for
  Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
  Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
  respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.
  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
  arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
  parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
  granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
  automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
  period specified above.
<P>
  (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
  Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
  Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
  effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
  distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
  Participant.
<P>
  8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
  Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor
  Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such
  claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to
  the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
  reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
  under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
  determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
<P>
  8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
  above,  all end user license agreements (excluding
  distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by
  You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
  survive termination.
<P>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<P>
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
  INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR
  OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
  LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
  COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
  COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
  BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
  OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
  THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<P>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
<P>
  The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is
  defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
  "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
  software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.
  12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
  C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
  Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
  rights set forth herein.
<P>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.
<P>
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning
  subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
  held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
  only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
  License shall be governed by California law provisions (except
  to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
  excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
  disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
  entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
  States of America, any litigation relating to this License
  shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of
  the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa
  Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible
  for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
  the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
  regulation which provides that the language of a contract
  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
  License.
<P>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
<P>
  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party
  is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
  indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
  License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
  basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
  constitute any admission of liability.
<P>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
<P>
  Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code
  as ?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the
  Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the
  Covered Code under Your choice of the alternative licenses, if
  any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described
  in Exhibit A.
<P>

Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable 

version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an 

Executable version available;</a> and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, 

must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became 

available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular 

Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring 

that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism 

is maintained by a third party.<br><br>

<dd>3.3. Description of Modifications.<br><br>

<dd><a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting 

the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. </a>You must 

include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from 

Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial 

Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related 

documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br><br>

<dd>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.<br><br>

<dd>(a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third 

party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such 

Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source 

Code distribution titled &quot;../LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the 

claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor 

obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, 

Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available 

thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 

newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new 

knowledge has been obtained.<br><br>

<dd>(b) Contributor APIs.<br><br>

<dd>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface 

(&quot;API&quot;../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably 

necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL 

file.<br><br>

<dd>(c) Representations.<br><br>

<dd><a name="IPWarrantRestrictionLicense">Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, 

Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) 

and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License</a><br>

<dd>.<br><br>

</dl>3.5. Required Notices.<br><br>
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not 

possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You 

must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be 

likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add 

your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate 

this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights 

or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense1">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee 

for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of 

Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the 

Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such 

warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby 

agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by 

the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or 

liability terms You offer.</a><br><br>
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br><br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 

3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the 

Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, 

including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. 

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related 

documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered 

Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a 

license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that 

You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable 

version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version 

from the rights set forth in this License. <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense2">If You distribute the Executable version under a 

different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 

License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You 

hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 

incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You 

offer.</a><br><br>
3.7. Larger Works.<br><br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the 

terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, 

You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered 

Code.<br><br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br><br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to 

some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: 

(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe 

the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL 

file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source 

Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be 

sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br><br>
5. Application of this License.<br><br>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in 

Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br><br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>

<dl>
<dd>6.1. New Versions. <br><br>

<dd>Sun Microsystems, Inc. (&quot;Sun&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the 

License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 

<br><br>

<dd>6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br><br>

<dd>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may 

always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such 

Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No 

one other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created 

under this License.<br><br>

<dd>6.3. Derivative Works.<br><br>

<dd>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order 

to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must: 

(a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Sun,&quot; &quot;Sun Public License,&quot; 

or &quot;SPL&quot;../ or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license 

(except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear 

that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Sun Public License. 

(Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice 

described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 

License.)<br><br>

</dl><a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense">7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br><br>
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;../AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 

OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE 

COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 

NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS 

WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL 

DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 

CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO 

USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</a><br><br>
8. TERMINATION.<br><br>

<dl>
<dd>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You 

fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 

aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall 

survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in 

effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br><br>

<dd>8.2. <a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding 

declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial 

Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as 

&quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:<br><br>

<dd>(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, 

then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of 

this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if 

within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a 

mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by 

such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor 

Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and 

payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation 

claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 

2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified 

above.<br><br>

<dd>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor 

Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such 

Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first 

made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br><br>

</dl>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such 

Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such 

claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 

infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such 

Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount 

or value of any payment or license.</a><br><br>
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license 

agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or 

any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>
<a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br><br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 

CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 

DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON 

FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, 

WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 

MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 

HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL 

NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE 

TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 

EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND 

LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU</a>.<br><br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br><br>
The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 

2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and 

&quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot;../ as such terms are used in 48 

C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 

through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only 

those rights set forth herein. <br><br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br><br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any 

provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only 

to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California 

law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding 

its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a 

citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of 

America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the 

Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara 

County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without 

limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the 

United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 

excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be 

construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br><br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br><br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and 

damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License 

and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such 

responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to 

constitute any admission of liability. <br><br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as 

?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial Developer permits you to 

utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, 

specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br><br>

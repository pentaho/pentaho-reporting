/**
 * A database is a two dimensional collection of data, arranged in a table.

 * Columns may have names, but there is no enforced requirement for that.
 *
 * As a database is not just a collection of raw data, this interface returns
 * LValues instead of plain objects. Columns may be computed values using
 * formulas (the exact semantics of adressing database cells in a formula is
 * beyond the scope of this specification and is implementation specific).

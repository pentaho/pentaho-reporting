/**
 * Defines the floating property. Floating elements create a new flow inside
 * an existing flow.
 * <p/>
 * The properties left and top are equivalent, as as right and bottom.
 * All properties in the specification can be reduced to either left or
 * right in the computation phase.
 * <p/>
 * Floating images cannot leave their containing block vertically or horizontally.
 * If negative margins are given, they may be shifted outside the content area,
 * but vertical margins will increase the 'empty-space' between the blocks instead
 * of messing up the previous element.

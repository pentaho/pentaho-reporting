   * Compares its two arguments for order.  Returns a negative integer, zero, or
   * a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater
   * than the second.<p>
   * <p/>
   * The implementor must ensure that <tt>sgn(compare(x, y)) == -sgn(compare(y,
   * x))</tt> for all <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  (This implies that
   * <tt>compare(x, y)</tt> must throw an exception if and only if
   * <tt>compare(y, x)</tt> throws an exception.)<p>
   * <p/>
   * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
   * <tt>((compare(x, y)&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (compare(y, z)&gt;0))</tt> implies
   * <tt>compare(x, z)&gt;0</tt>.<p>
   * <p/>
   * Finally, the implementer must ensure that <tt>compare(x, y)==0</tt> implies
   * that <tt>sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z))</tt> for all
   * <tt>z</tt>.<p>
   * <p/>
   * It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that
   * <tt>(compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</tt>.  Generally speaking, any
   * comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.
   * The recommended language is "Note: this comparator imposes orderings that
   * are inconsistent with equals."
   *
   * @param o1 the first object to be compared.
   * @param o2 the second object to be compared.
   * @return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first
   *         argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
   * @throws ClassCastException if the arguments' types prevent them from being
   *                            compared by this Comparator.

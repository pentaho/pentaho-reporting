  <description>a derivative work of http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/SAC/Overview.en.html

    The grammar of the parser has been changed to be a little bit more suitable
    for CSS3.

    The @page-rule grammer given in the CSS3-Page module was funny, but unusable.
    Therefore it has been replaced by a simplicistic approach. The margin-rules
    now have to follow the property declarations - mixing margins and property
    declarations is no longer valid.

    The margin-box rules get forwarded to the 'ignorableAtRule' method of the
    Handler class - we have to maintain API level compatibility for BIRT and other
    projects, which may depend on that parser.

    The selector syntax is also upgraded to CSS3 - especially the pseudo-elements
    were not parsed and caused trouble here. As this did not work before,
    stylesheets of other programms should not be affected by this change - if they
    specified things which were known not to work and start dying if it works -
    well, that's bad luck, I guess.</description>

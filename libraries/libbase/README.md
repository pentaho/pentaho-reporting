LibBase - A general purpose base service library
================================================


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibBase is a library developed to provide base services like
logging, configuration and initialization to all other libraries
and applications. The library is the root library for all other
Pentaho-Reporting projects.

2. SUPPORT
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho Reporting forum, follow
the link from the LibBase home page. Please note that questions are
answered by volunteers, so there is no guaranteed response time or
level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.

3. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------
If you find bugs in LibBase, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of LibBase.  Please post a bug report
in our JIRA bug-tracking system at:

    http://jira.pentaho.com/browse/PRD

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of LibBase that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


4. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibBase.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.6) is included in the distribution:

    <libbase-directory>/build.xml

You can find out more about Ant at:

    http://ant.apache.org/

Ant is licensed under the terms of the Apache Software License (a
popular open source software license).

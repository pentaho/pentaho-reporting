LibDocBundle - A free document archive library
==============================================


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibDocBundle is a library developed to provide a transparent
document bundle service to applications. With LibDocBundle an
application can hold documents and all referenced resources in
a single storage (a zip-file or a directory) without knowing
details about the storage method itself. Therefore application
developers do not have to deal with ZIP-Access or File-access
by themselves.

LibDocBundle integrates into LibLoader and provides means to
read and write document bundles.

2. SUPPORT
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho Reporting forum, follow
the link from the LibDocBundle home page. Please note that questions are
answered by volunteers, so there is no guaranteed response time or
level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.

3. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------
If you find bugs in LibDocBundle, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of LibDocBundle.  Please post a bug report
in our JIRA bug-tracking system at:

    http://jira.pentaho.org/browse/PRD

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of LibDocBundle that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


4. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibDocBundle.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.6) is included in the distribution:

    <LibDocBundle-directory>/build.xml

You can find out more about Ant at:

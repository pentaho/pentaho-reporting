LibXML
======


1. Introduction
---------------

LibXML is a namespace aware SAX-Parser utility library. It eases the
pain of implementing non-trivial SAX input handlers. The original
code of these classes had been written by Peter Becker for the
JCommon library.

LibXML replaces the JCommon-XML classes, which were not namespace aware.
Due to JCommons frozen API, namespace awareness could not be added to
the original code without creating a mess.

2. Support
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho Reporting forum, follow the link
from the LibXml home page.  Please note that questions are
answered by volunteers, so there is no guaranteed response time or
level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.


3. Reporting Bugs
-----------------
If you find bugs in LibXml, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of LibXml.  Please post a bug report
to the JIRA bug-tracker at Pentaho.org:

    http://jira.pentaho.com/

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of LibXml that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


4. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibXml.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.6) is included in the distribution:

    <libxml-directory>/ant/build.xml

You can find out more about Ant at:

LibSparkline - A free sparkline graph library
=============================================


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibSparkline is a library developed to render sparkline graphs.
Sparklines are small-scale bar or line-charts that are inserted
into text to provide visualized information along with the textual
description.

LibSparkline is based on the work of Larry Ogrodnek and therefore
licensed under the terms of the Apache Software License 2.0.

LibSparkline required at least JDK 1.5.


2. SUPPORT
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho Reporting forum, follow
the link from the LibSparkline home page. Please note that questions are
answered by volunteers, so there is no guaranteed response time or

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the

If you find bugs in LibSparkline, we'd like to hear about it so that we

We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibSparkline.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.6) is included in the distribution:

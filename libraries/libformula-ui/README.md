LibFormula-UI
=============



1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibFormula-UI is a formula editor for OpenFormula expressions based on
LibFormula.

LibFormula provides Excel-Style-Expressions. The implementation provided
here is very generic and can be used in any application that needs to
compute formulas.

The syntax is based on the OpenFormula-specifications, but with carefully
pruning away all the spreadsheet specific parts (like references to
cell-ranges).

2. SUPPORT
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho Reporting forum, follow the link
from the LibFormula home page.  Please note that questions are
answered by volunteers, so there is no guaranteed response time or
level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.


3. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------
If you find bugs in LibFormula, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of LibFormula.  Please post a bug report
to the JIRA bug-tracker at Pentaho.org:

    http://jira.pentaho.org/

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of LibFormula that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


4. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibFormula.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.6) is included in the distribution:

    <libformula-directory>/build.xml

You can find out more about Ant at:

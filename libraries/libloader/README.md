1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibLoader is a general purpose resource loading framework. It has been
designed to allow to load resources from any physical location and to
allow the processing of that content data in a generic way, totally
transparent to the user of that library.

2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------
LibLoader needs at least JDK 1.5 for its core functionality.


3. SUPPORT

Free support is available via the Pentaho forum, follow the link

4. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------
If you find bugs in LibLoader, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of LibLoader.  Please post a bug report
to the JIRA bug-tracker at Pentaho.org:

    http://jira.pentaho.org/browse/PRD

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of LibLoader that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


5. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibLoader.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.7.0) is included in the distribution:

    <libloader-directory>/build.xml

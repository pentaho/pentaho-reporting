1.  Introduction
-----------------
Pixie is a WMF-File reading library originally written by David R. Harris as
converter for the Pixie-ImageViewer. Pixie was long time dead and is now
resurrected as WMF-Reader and ImageProducer for Java 1.2.2 or higher.

Pixie lacks the support for most BitMap-Formats but everything else is working
fine. Write-Support will be implemented somewhere in the future, classes
for the writesupport are mostly dummies at the moment.

Pixie is licensed, free of charge, under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public Licence.  A copy of the licence is included in the download.

The latest version of this class library can be obtained from:

message in the JFreeReport forum.


2.  Contributors
----------------
We whish to thank the original developer of the gnu.bhresearch package,
from where the initial version of this code was forked. 


3. Requirements
---------------
Pixie needs at least JDK 1.2.2 for its core functionality.


4. Support
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho forum, follow the link
from the home page.  Please note that questions are answered by volunteers, 
so there is no guaranteed response time or level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.

5. Reporting Bugs
-----------------
If you find bugs in Pixie, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of Pixie.  Please post a bug report
to the JIRA bug-tracker at Pentaho.org:

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of Pixie that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


6. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build Pixie.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.7.0) is included in the distribution:

    <pixie-directory>/build.xml

 * Checks for break-opportunities. The break opportunity is always a break after

 * to a grapheme cluster.
 * <p/>
 * This means, if we test the sequence 'ab', we cannot be sure that the letter
 * 'a' is breakable, unless we've seen 'b' and have verified that 'b' is no
 * extension or formatting character.
 * <p/>
 * To use this producer properly, make sure that no extension characters get
 * fed into it.

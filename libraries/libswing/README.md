LibSwing
========


1. Introduction
---------------

LibSwing is a common helper class storage for design-time elements,
so that they dont have to move into the engine project, where they
potentially bloat up the project due to third-party dependencies or
a large amount of code.

For the latest news and information about LibSwing, please refer to:

    http://reporting.pentaho.org/libswing/

2. Support
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho Reporting forum, follow the link
from the LibSwing home page.  Please note that questions are
answered by volunteers, so there is no guaranteed response time or
level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.


3. Reporting Bugs
-----------------
If you find bugs in LibSwing, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of LibSwing.  Please post a bug report
to the JIRA bug-tracker at Pentaho.org:

    http://jira.pentaho.com/

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of LibSwing that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


4. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibSwing.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.6) is included in the distribution:

    <libswing-directory>/ant/build.xml

You can find out more about Ant at:

    http://ant.apache.org/

Ant is licensed under the terms of the Apache Software License (a
popular open source software license).

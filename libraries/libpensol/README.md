1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibPensol is an access layer for accessing a remote Pentaho Solution Repository
via an Apache-VFS filesystem. It handles all HTTP calls and the parsing of
the XML file and all client-side state managements.

2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------
LibPensol needs at least JDK 1.5 for its core functionality.


3. SUPPORT
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho forum, follow the link
from the home page.  Please note that questions are answered by volunteers,
so there is no guaranteed response time or level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.

4. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------
If you find bugs in LibPensol, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of LibPensol.  Please post a bug report
to the JIRA bug-tracker at Pentaho.org:

    http://jira.pentaho.org/browse/PRD

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to

and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


5. ANT

We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibPensol.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.7.0) is included in the distribution:

    <libpensol-directory>/build.xml

strings as well.

in our JIRA bug-tracking system at:

    http://jira.pentaho.org/browse/PRD

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to

We use an open source build tool called Ant to build LibFormat.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.6) is included in the distribution:
